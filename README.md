# Key Tool

keytool is a Java utility used to create keystores and manage cryptographic keys â€” essential for signing Android apps. It comes with the Java Development Kit (JDK).

Step 1: Make Sure JDK Is Installed Open PowerShell and run: java -version

If it isn't installed, install the Java JDK from Oracle

If it is installed, you may have to set the environment variables to point to its bin directory as that is where keytool is installed

set JAVA_HOME to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-24 (or wherever yours is installed)
set PATH to include %JAVA_HOME%\bin

* You may have to restart Visual Studio or the Command Prompt for it to pick up these changes *

## Publish Android

Navigate to your .csproj file directory and issue the following commands to generate a keystore and aab

# Generate Keystore file

Running the following will generate a keystore that can be used to sign the Android App

keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore {filename}.keystore -alias {keyname} -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Generate Android Bundle

To create and Android Bundle signed with the certificate, run the following

dotnet publish ./WidgetBoard/WidgetBoard.csproj --framework net8.0-android34.0 -p:ApplicationVersion="1" -p:AndroidKeyStore=true -p:AndroidSigningKeyStore="{filename}.keystore" -p:AndroidSigningKeyAlias={keyname} -p:AndroidSigningKeyPass="{keypassword}" -p:AndroidSigningStorePass="{keypassword}"
